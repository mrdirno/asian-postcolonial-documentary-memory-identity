## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where a character discovers a mundane object (a comb, a specific spice jar, a faded postcard) that triggers a visceral, non-visual memory of a place they've left.
- Compose a bureaucratic memo or list that details the 'disposal' of a community's cultural artifacts, focusing on the chillingly neutral language of erasure.
- Create a dialogue where an elder offers a story that is framed not as a tale, but as a 'correction' to a younger person's understanding of the past.
- Describe a character meticulously documenting someone else's trauma, while internally wrestling with their own inability to confront a personal silence.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build a 'Memory Atlas' interface that maps fragments of the novel (sensory details, objects, phrases) not chronologically, but by emotional weight and thematic connection, allowing a non-linear exploration of the protagonist's psyche.
- Create an 'Archive Simulator' where users sift through procedurally generated, partially redacted colonial documents, facing the frustration and occasional revelation of historical research where most trails lead to 'incinerated.'
